MapKit, MKMapView, CLLocationManager, CLGeocoder

This project demonstrates basic map abilities in iOS. You can find here usage of `MKMapView` with different settings,
`CLLocationManager` with delegate for handling user location events and `CLGeocoder` for reverse geocoding of current 
coordinates to readable address. Also you will learn about map annotations and way to build routes using default iOS
map application. You can improve this project by adding more markers on map, switch between map and list modes, 
additional view controllers etc
